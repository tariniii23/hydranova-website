    <h3>Why HydraNova?</h3>

        <div class="card">
            🌱 <strong>Sustainable</strong><br><br>
            HydraNova 1.0 uses hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity, producing zero carbon emissions during flight. Unlike conventional jet fuel, hydrogen does not release CO₂, helping reduce aviation’s contribution to climate change and air pollution while supporting a cleaner, more sustainable future for air travel.

        <div class="card">
            🔇 <strong>Quieter Skies</strong><br><br>
            HydraNova’s electric propulsion system operates far more quietly than traditional jet engines. This significantly reduces noise pollution during takeoff, landing, and cruising, improving quality of life for communities near airports and making air travel less disruptive to urban and residential areas.

            ✈️ <strong>Practical Design</strong><br><br>
            Designed with real-world aviation needs in mind, HydraNova 1.0 can carry up to 160 passengers, making it suitable for regular commercial routes. Its modular systems and efficient design ensure reliability, scalability, and easier integration into existing airline operations without compromising performance.
